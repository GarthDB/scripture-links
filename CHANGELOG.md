## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a644df1`](https://github.com/GarthDB/scripture-links/commit/a644df197e1cf467458dbed6f1d21d860422b19c) Thanks [@GarthDB](https://github.com/GarthDB)! - Add comprehensive Study Helps support with configurable text processing

  This release adds support for LDS Study Helps abbreviations and references, including:

  **New Study Helps Supported:**

  - JST (Joseph Smith Translation)
  - TG (Topical Guide)
  - BD (Bible Dictionary)
  - IT (Index to the Triple Combination)
  - GS (Guide to the Scriptures)
  - HC (History of the Church)

  **Key Features:**

  - **Smart URL Generation**: Automatically generates correct URLs for Study Helps entries with topic-specific slugs
  - **Index to Triple Combination Support**: Special handling for IT entries that use the `triple-index` URL pattern
  - **Topic Slug Conversion**: Converts complex topics like "Aaron, Brother of Moses" to URL-friendly slugs like "aaron-brother-of-moses"
  - **Configurable Text Processing**: Study Helps processing is disabled by default to avoid false positives, but can be enabled with the new `process_text_with_options()` function
  - **False Positive Prevention**: Uses restrictive patterns to minimize false matches (e.g., "IT department" vs "IT Accountability")

  **New API:**

  - Added `process_text_with_options(text, include_study_helps)` function for configurable text processing
  - Extended `ScriptureReference` type with optional `topic` field for Study Helps entries
  - Added `StandardWork::StudyHelps` variant with `is_study_help()` method

  **Examples:**

  - `TG Faith` ‚Üí `https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/faith?lang=eng`
  - `BD Abraham` ‚Üí `https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/abraham?lang=eng`
  - `IT Accountability, Age of` ‚Üí `https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/triple-index/accountability-age-of?lang=eng`

  This enhancement maintains full backward compatibility while significantly expanding the library's capabilities for LDS scripture study resources.
